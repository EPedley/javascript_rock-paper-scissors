# rock_paper_scissors

As part of my progress through The Odin Project I have created a rock, paper, scissors game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The game:
- Lets the user select their weapon of choice
- Randomly selects a weapon from the computer and displays this to the user
- Runs the game and shows the winner
- Keeps track of the score between user and computer
- Once 5 points is reached directs the user either to a winning or losing page

Working through this project I have learnt to do the following:
- Create and manipulate variables
- Use operators
- Work with different data types
- Work with comparison operators and conditionals
- Work with truthy and falsy values
- How to define and invoke different functions
- What function scope is
