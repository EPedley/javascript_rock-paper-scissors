# rock_paper_scissors

As part of my progress through The Odin Project, I coded a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The game generates a random choice from the computer, and selects the player's choice from the button they click.

Once the player or computer hits 5 points, the user is taken to a game over / winner's screen, where they have the option of restarting their game.

This also enabled me to practice proper git management.
